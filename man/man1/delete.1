.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBdelete\fP command is a simple alternative to using the standard \fBrm\fP command.
Using \fBrm\fP as a matter of course can be dangerous and prone to mistakes. Once a file is
unlinked with \fBrm\fP it cannot be recovered (without having backups).
.sp
All major graphical environments offer a "move to trash" option. This does a clean move
operation to a "trash" folder. Once a file as been put in the trash it can be recovered
easily. Periodically, the trash can be emptied if desired.
.sp
\fBdelete\fP is a command line implementation of this metaphor. It maintains a basic
\fBsqlite3\fP database of files and folders put in the trash. Using the \fB\-\-list\fP option
will list the contents. Using \fB\-\-restore\fP will restore a file or folder from the trash.
Using \fB\-\-empty\fP will purge anything put in the trash by \fBdelete\fP\&.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
\fBTRASH_FOLDER\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
By default, the program will move objects to the \fB~/.Trash\fP folder. This is for
consistency with systems like macOS and most Linux distributions. In this way, the
\fIempty trash\fP operation on these systems will also remove anything put there by the
\fBdelete\fP program via the command line. You can specify a different location via
the \fBTRASH_FOLDER\fP environment variable. For example, in your \fB~/.bashrc\fP\&.

\fBTRASH_DATABASE\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
By default, the path to the database is \fB${TRASH_FOLDER}.db\fP, which would be
\fB~/.Trash.db\fP if the \fBTRASH_FOLDER\fP environment variable is undefined. This path
\fIshould not\fP be inside the trash folder. You can specify a different location via
the \fBTRASH_DATABASE\fP environment variable. For example, in your \fB~/.bashrc\fP\&.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
Deleting files and folders is as simple as:

.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
delete file1.txt file2.txt folderA
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Files or folders that get deleted with the same basename will have a suffix added before
the extension (e.g., \fBfile1.1.txt\fP, \fBfile1.2.txt\fP, ...).
.sp
Restore files using their basename (in the trash), their full path (in the trash) or
their original full path.
.INDENT 0.0

Use \fB\-\-empty\fP to completely empty the trash. This does not remove the
\fB$TRASH_FOLDER\fP\&. It iterates through the full listing of contents from the
\fB$TRASH_DATABASE\fP\&. If anything is left in the directory an error is logged.

.SH BUGS
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
On \fImacOS\fP systems the default \fB~/.Trash\fP is protected and does not allow a listing
of the directory. \fBdelete\fP functions normally aside from an error message being printed
when using \fB\-\-empty\fP\&.
